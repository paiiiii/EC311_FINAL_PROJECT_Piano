This is the fianal project of EC311, team 14, by Pai Liu, Wenjun Ma, Xinyu Liu.

This is a FPGA base e-piano

The deceive we use is NEXYS A7.

In this project, 
There is one input, key press on the keyboard, and two outputs, 7 segment display, and speaker.
There are three main part, the first one is the PS2 Recevier, the input keypress get into this module, and generate keycode and pass it to the second and third moduel, 7seg-decoder moduel,
and Meldoy moduel, this two moduel give us the two outputs.

This is a very basic e-piano, there are things we need to fix and add on.

In the future we have a plan to add:

Additional mode: Learning Mode
The 7 segment display will tell the user which key need to push next, and finally end up with a song.

Memory Mode:
FPGA will play back what you just play.

If there is any question, free to contect me, and make any change.

There is more detial in the powerpoint.

this is the demo video
